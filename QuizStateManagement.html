<h2> Answers for Servlet Quiz</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p class="question">Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</p>
        <p class="answer">An HTTP POST can be bookmarked, but since a bookmark only consists of the URL, all of the form
            parameters will be lost. This will often mean that the web server doesn't know what to do with the
            request, since it was expecting some form parameters. A POST cannot be bookmarked </p>
    </li>

    <li><p class="question">Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</p>
        <p class="answer"> It is Java class that allows for 'including' content in a request/response or 'forwarding' a
            request/response to a resource</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is the purpose of request dispatching?</p>
        <p class="answer"> <strong>sendRedirect</strong>
            This method is used to redirect client request to some other location for further processing ,the
            new location is available on different server or different context.our web container handle this
            and transfer the request using browser ,and this request is visible in browser as a new request.
            Some time this is also called as client side redirect.
        <strong>forward</strong>
            This method is used to pass the request to another resource for further processing within the
            same server, another resource could be any servlet, jsp page any kind of file.This process is taken
            care by web container when we call forward method request is sent to another resource without
            the client being informed, which resource will handle the request it has been mention on
            requestDispatcher object which we can get by two ways either using ServletContext or Request.
            This is also called server side redirect.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
    </p>
        <p class="answer"> An attribute is an object that is used to share information in a web app. Attribute allows Servlets
            to share information among themselves. Attributes can be SET and GET from one of the
            following scopes :
            1. request
            2. session
            3. application</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is an attribute ?</p>
        <p class="answer">It is Java class that allows for 'including' content in a request/response or 'forwarding' a
            request/response to a resource </p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</p>
        <p class="answer">Request parameters are the result of submitting an HTTP request with a query string that specifies the
            name/value pairs, or of submitting an HTML form that specifies the name/value pairs. The name and the
            values are always strings.
            Request attributes (more correctly called "request-scoped variables") are objects of any type that are
            explicitly placed on the request object via a call to the setAttribute() method. They are retrieved in Java
            code via the getAttribute() method and in JSP pages with Expression Language references. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What are dangers of using attributes?</p>
            because both systems maintain information about the session itself during its life</p>
            <p class="answer">Parameters are read only while attributes are read/write objects. These may pose a problem as they
                may be overwritten. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</p>
        <p class="answer"> Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be
            handled based entirely on information that comes with it. Every web request is new to the server even if
            coming from the same browser. which means that the connection between the browser and the server
            is lost once the transaction ends. In contrast, a protocol that requires keeping of the internal state on
            the server is known as a stateful protocol. A TCP connection-oriented session is a 'stateful' connection
            because both systems maintain information about the session itself during its life</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
        method).
        </p>
        <p class="answer"> 1. request scope: destroyed when servletfinishes processing request
            2. session scope: destroyed when user closes browser
            3.application scope destroyed when Container stopped.
            4.Cookies saved on browser, temporary (deleted when the browser closes) and permanent
            5.Hidden fields on a form</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">How long does a session last?</p>
        <p class="answer"> How long does a session last? By default, a session lasts until there's 30 minutes of inactivity, but you
            can adjust this limit so a session lasts from a few seconds to several hours.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</p>
        <p class="answer"> Cookies are small data files that are placed on computer or mobile device when visiting a website.
            Cookies can remain on a computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are
            ‘session cookies’, which means they only exist when a browser is open and are automatically deleted
            when browser is closed or quit the app. Other cookies are ‘persistent cookies’, meaning they survive
            after a browser or app is closed and can be used by websites or apps to recognize a computer when you
            re-opening browser or app later.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
    </p>
        <p class="answer"> Url rewriting is a process of appending or modifying any url structure while loading a page.
            If your browser does not support cookies, URL rewriting provides you with another session tracking
            alternative. URL rewriting is a method in which the requested URL is modified to include a session ID.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?
    </p>
        <p class="answer"> May be session timeout</p>
    </li>
